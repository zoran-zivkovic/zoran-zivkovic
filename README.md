### Probabilistic modelling:

Probablistic modelling is the main principle behind my work and my main background. I had the privilege to learn from some realy great people at University of Amsterdam [ML lab](https://amlab.science.uva.nl/). Here are a few selected interesting things I did in the past:

- Mixture modelling and on-the fly model selection - an approximate method based on the Minimum Message Length for adaptive model selection ([paper](./papers/zivkovic2004PAMI.pdf),[matlab code](./code/demoEM1.zip))

- Background modelling - the adaptive model from above and some other non parametric models are used to model background pixels ([paper](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1.4658&rep=rep1&type=pdf), [original c code](./code/CvBSLib.zip)). The code was merged into the [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) and is the main image background modellng for many years. The OpenCV names of the two methods are:
cv::BackgroundSubtractorMOG2 and cv::BackgroundSubtractorKNN.

- Robust mode finding - inspired by some notes from Tom Minka I derived this extension of the popular mean-shift mode finding. The mode position and the covariance can be simultaneoisly estimated ([paper](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.77.7277&rep=rep1&type=pdf),[matlab code](./code/EMShiftDemo.zip)) 

- Part based modelling - ...

### User interfaces:

I was always interested in the new user interfaces. various aspects and using various sensors.

- ICCV 2001 demo and paper on camera based 3D face tracing. Real time demo on Intel Pentium III 450MHz! ([paper](./papers/paper.pdf), [demo](https://youtu.be/DHVFyeE4R2o))
- Camera based games using optical flow and OpenCV ()
- Active illumination
- Light sensor

### Robot navigation:

For a while I was busy with the robot navigation. The main theme was to
